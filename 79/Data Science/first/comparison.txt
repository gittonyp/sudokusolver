Jupyter Notebook is like having a super flexible friend who can do anything you want. You can write code, draw diagrams, and even make presentations all in one place. It's like having a digital notebook where you can jot down your thoughts and ideas. Plus, it's super easy to share your work with others.
PyCharm, on the other hand, is like having a personal coach who knows all your coding secrets. It's got all the bells and whistles, like code completion, debugging, and testing. Plus, it's super fast and efficient.
So, which one is better? Honestly, it depends on your vibe and what you're working on. If you're just messing around with some data or want to create a quick presentation, Jupyter Notebook is the way to go. But if you're working on a big project or need to collaborate with others, PyCharm is the way to go.
but i think it is better to use pycharm or jetbrains specialized ide for data science but still the datashell ide is paid. so i think the jupyter is better for datascicene and pycharm is good for all round python.
